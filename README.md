# Bank-Campaign-Prediction
Predicting success of campaign of a Portuguese Bank.

The Portuguese Bank had run a telemarketing campaign in the past, making sales calls for a term-deposit product. Whether a prospect had bought the product or not is mentioned in the column named 'response'.The project is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
The marketing team wants to launch another campaign, and they want to learn from the past one.
